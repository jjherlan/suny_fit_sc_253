James J. Herlan

As a graduate student, I focus on the modularity, interconnectedness, and resilience of marine populations, communities, and ecosystems [-@nordbotten_ecological_2018].

What is Ecology?

::: incremental

- The science by which we study how organisms (animals, plants, and microbes) interact with each other and with their environment.
- Environment: Everything external to the organism: abiotic and biotic.
  - Biotic: living things in the environment 
  - Abiotic: non-living things in the environment

What are some of the physical (i.e., abiotic) and biological (i.e., biotic) processes in this photo?

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ecology is a broad  and diverse field.

::: incremental

- Direct and indirect interactions between organisms.
- Physical processes and chemical substances are affected by other organisms.
  - Once we couple the diverse biotic and complex abiotic components, we can get a sense of the breadth of Ecology.

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Direct and interactions between organisms... humans and organisms... humans and abiotic factors... biotic factors?

History of Ecology

- Ernst Haeckel, 1868
  - From the Greek word... oikos or home
  - "Describes the housekeeping habits of organisms" 
  
- G. Evelyn Hutchinson (1903 - 1991)
  - Modern Ecology
  - Published "Treatise on Limnology" in 1957

Ecology - changes in perspective

- Started as a descriptive science
  - Describes phenomena and patterns ("stamp collecting")
  - i.e., WHAT?

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

Origins and mechanisms of interactions

- i.e., the HOW? and WHY?
- A functional and evolutionary approach
- Ecological setting acts a stage for evolutionary processes

Why is Ecology so cool?

- Why do pikas collect certain plants for winter?
  - Plants with higher toxin content on bottom of pile.

- Plants, habitat impact, and adaptation to climate change

Why is Ecology so cool?

- Why do monarch butterflies migrate such long distances?
  - Monarchs travel 3,000 miles from the United States to the mountains of Mexico.
  - It takes multiple generations of butterflies to make the round-trip journey.

Why is Ecology so cool?

- How do monarch butterflies migrate such long distances?
  - Use signals from the changing of the seasons and availability of their main food source (milkweed plants).
  - Their overwintering habitats are in danger from habitat conversion to agriculture.
  
- Why do they migrate?
  - To follow food?
  - To escape parasites and disease?

Why is Ecology so cool?

- Why do three-toed sloths poop on the ground?
- Positive interactions between sloths, moths, and algae!
  - 3-way mutualism
  - This does not occur in sloth species that poop while in trees.

Why is Ecology so cool?

- How does climate change impact wildlife?
- Bears aren't hibernating or they are waking up early
  - "...where a 1 $^\circ$C increase in the winter minimum temperature is associated with a 6-day reduction in the black bear hibernation; by 2050, the average length of bear hibernation in our study area could decline by 8 to 22 days [-@johnson_human_2018]."

Why is Ecology so cool?

- Shorter hibernation may mean more conflicts between bears and people.
- How they respond to changes in their food sources is still being investigated.

Ecology helps us understand humans' interactions with the environment

- Example: Human population growth
  - What have we seen in the past?
  - What do we predict for the future?
-Use math to do this
