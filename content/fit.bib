              This work contains two major theoretical contributions: Firstly, we define a general set of measures, referred to as interconnectedness, which generalizes and combines classical notions of diversity and modularity. Secondly, we analyze the temporal evolution of interconnectedness based on a microscale model of ecoevolutionary dynamics. This we do by providing a platform for understanding how and why macroecological phenomena change over long time scales. Such a platform allows us to show how the drivers of the dynamics of macroecological descriptors, such as interconnectedness, can be partitioned into three components: (
              i
              ) ecologically driven change, (
              ii
              ) evolutionarily driven change, and (
              iii
              ) environmentally driven change.
            
          , 
            
              In this contribution, we develop a theoretical framework for linking microprocesses (i.e., population dynamics and evolution through natural selection) with macrophenomena (such as interconnectedness and modularity within an ecological system). This is achieved by developing a measure of interconnectedness for population distributions defined on a trait space (generalizing the notion of modularity on graphs), in combination with an evolution equation for the population distribution. With this contribution, we provide a platform for understanding under what environmental, ecological, and evolutionary conditions ecosystems evolve toward being more or less modular. A major contribution of this work is that we are able to decompose the overall driver of changes at the macro level (such as interconnectedness) into three components: (
              i
              ) ecologically driven change, (
              ii
              ) evolutionarily driven change, and (
              iii
              ) environmentally driven change.},

	abstract = {Arboreal herbivory is rare among mammals. The few species with this lifestyle possess unique adaptions to overcome size-related constraints on nutritional energetics. Sloths are folivores that spend most of their time resting or eating in the forest canopy. A three-toed sloth will, however, descend its tree weekly to defecate, which is risky, energetically costly and, until now, inexplicable. We hypothesized that this behaviour sustains an ecosystem in the fur of sloths, which confers cryptic nutritional benefits to sloths. We found that the more specialized three-toed sloths harboured more phoretic moths, greater concentrations of inorganic nitrogen and higher algal biomass than the generalist two-toed sloths. Moth density was positively related to inorganic nitrogen concentration and algal biomass in the fur. We discovered that sloths consumed algae from their fur, which was highly digestible and lipid-rich. By descending a tree to defecate, sloths transport moths to their oviposition sites in sloth dung, which facilitates moth colonization of sloth fur. Moths are portals for nutrients, increasing nitrogen levels in sloth fur, which fuels algal growth. Sloths consume these algae-gardens, presumably to augment their limited diet. These linked mutualisms between moths, sloths and algae appear to aid the sloth in overcoming a highly constrained lifestyle.},

Thus, this review has as its main objective to show the current state of studies of microplastics, as well as to determine the groups of vertebrates most affected by microplastics, and the type and predominant color of microplastics. For this research, we review a total of 132 articles, from 2010 to May of 2020. Our results show that the group more affected are turtles with 88\% of the specimens contaminated by microplastics and median of 121.73 particles/individue. The predominant type is fibers (67.3\%), polymer is polyethylene (27.3\%), size is less than 2 mm (73.6\%), and color is blue (32.9\%).},
